For the following statistics, missing values (if any) are not counted.
Further, structurally determined entries are treated as observed entries,
except for calculating the distances, where missings and structurally determined entries
at the beginning or end of a period are disregarded.
This may imply that the columns 0 => 1 and 1 => 0 do not add up to the distance column.

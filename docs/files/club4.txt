Reading dependent actor variables.
----------------------------------

1st dependent actor variable named freq_run.
Maximum and minimum rounded values are 0 and 5.
Missing values in this actor variable are imputed by the mode per observation.
But if there is a previous (or later) nonmissing value, this is used as the imputed value.
Modal values:

Composition changes for nodeSet Actors.

Actor  2 joins  network at time 3.0000.
Actor  6 joins  network at time 10.0000.

In period 3, 1 actor joined and 0 actors left the network.

In period 10, 1 actor joined and 0 actors left the network.


There are missing data for network variable kudonet.
There are missing data for behavior variable freq_run.
The mean structural dissimilarity value subtracted in the
balance calculations is         0.4312.

For the similarity variable calculated from each actor covariate,
the mean is subtracted.
These means are:
Similarity gender                   :       0.5000 
Similarity freq_run                 :       0.7374
